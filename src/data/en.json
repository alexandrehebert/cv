  "description": "Passionate computer scientist, more precisely *full stack developer*, and with extensive experience in *agile methodologies*, I put my skills at the service of startups or multinationals, in *varied business fields* during more than *ten years*.\n\nI had the chance to join talented teams, following or not principles of so-called agile methodologies. I’ve worn *several hats* from lead developer to Scrum master in parallel to my development activities, and even CTO for a short period. But more than my solid experiences and development skills, I am *adaptable* and I’m always *striving to do better*.\n\nPlus, I like to bring *good vibes* and *best practices* (tests, continuous integration, etc.) wherever I go, wherever I work!",
